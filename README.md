In this lab, I explored image classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and the CIFAR-10 dataset.  I learned that SVM, while not typically used for image data, can be effective with adequate preprocessing.  This solidified the importance of data preparation, like flattening images and converting them to grayscale, which simplifies the data while preserving important information.  Â
