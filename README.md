I learned about the various algorithms, including YOLO, R-CNN, and SSD, each with its own strengths and weaknesses.  I also discovered the importance of libraries like TensorFlow and Keras, and tools like Histogram of Oriented Gradients and Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT).   

I gained insights into the technical aspects of object detection, such as bounding boxes, annotations, confidence scores, and Intersection over Union (IoU).  I also learned about the challenges in object detection, including time constraints, training time, resource intensiveness, and lower recall rates.    

Through hands-on experience with the SSD MobileNet V2 model and the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset, I gained a deeper understanding of model selection, evaluation, and interpretation.  I also developed technical skills in data preprocessing, adjusting model parameters, and interpreting heatmaps.    

This journey into object detection has not only broadened my technical knowledge but also ignited a quest for further exploration in the field of artificial intelligence.
