# Computer_Vision
I discuss image processing, a technique used to extract information from images.  I explore two libraries used in image processing: OpenCV and Pillow. OpenCV is a computer vision library that uses languages like Python, C++, Java, C, and Assembly language, while Pillow is a Python imaging library.  I also explore applications of both libraries. Applications for Pillow include basic image manipulation, addition of filters and effects, image compositing, automated image enhancements, and image format conversion.  Applications for OpenCV include real-time object detection, computer vision in robotics, image segmentation, and video processing.  I also provide an illustration of the use of face recognition and face capture technologies in a "day in the life" of a developer working in biometrics.  The key responsibilities in this scenario would involve algorithm design, image processing, work with machine learning models, code optimization, collaboration, research and development, testing and validation, and documentation.  I conclude by highlighting the training opportunities, courses, and continuous learning process available through the open-source platforms of Pillow and OpenCV
