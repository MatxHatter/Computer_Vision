I delved into the fascinating world of neural networks, particularly focusing on their application in image recognition.  I learned that a neural network is an AI algorithm that mimics the human brain, and it's the foundation for technologies like image and speech recognition and natural language processing.  Through hands-on experience, I gained a deeper understanding of the major components of a neural network, including neurons, activation functions, layers, weights, biases, optimization algorithms, loss functions, and backpropagation.    

I actively participated in creating a neural network with one hidden layer, utilizing the Sigmoid activation function.  The process involved adjusting parameters like the learning rate and batch size, and I observed the impact of these changes on the neural network's performance.  It was fascinating to see how the neural network learned from mistakes, adjusting internal weights and biases to improve its future performance.    

This deep dive into neural networks wasn't just theoretical; it also provided practical insights into real-world applications, such as the use of AI in medical dosimetry.  It was remarkable to learn how AI-powered auto-contouring programs are revolutionizing the field, significantly reducing the time required for complex tasks.    

In addition to the theoretical and practical exploration of neural networks, I also engaged in a hands-on lab activity focused on image classification. The "Chihuahua or Muffin" workshop provided a fun and challenging way to understand the complexities of image recognition in machine learning.    

Initially, I encountered challenges in setting up the coding environment and debugging code errors.  However, with the help of AI-powered tools and the collaborative nature of the workshop, I was able to overcome these obstacles and gain valuable insights into the iterative process of machine learning.    

This experience highlighted the crucial role of parameter adjustments, model architectures, and techniques like data augmentation in improving the accuracy of image classification models.  It also underscored the significance of good data and a carefully designed machine learning model for making accurate predictions.
